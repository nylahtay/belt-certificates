                    <h1>Important Notice</h1>
                    <p>There is no self defense program in the world that can guarantee that you will never become the victim of a violent crime. If you are a victim it is important to remember that there are procedures that should be followed to help give the best chance of your assailant being captured as well as for your recovery.</p>
                    
                    <p>Many women, due to the shame and trauma that this type of attack creates fail to report the crime. Often times they even have a difficult time discussing it with close friends and family members. It is still not the best, however, the legal system is beginning to treat the rape victim as a victim of violent crime and are slowly getting away from attacking the character of the victim with the “she asked for it” syndrome.</p>
                    <p>If you are the friend that is called for support of a victim. You should not say anything to make them feel as though they could have done something different. Their actions will always be the correct ones and represent what they feel they had to do to survive. One out of every 6 women in the United State will have a sexual assault in their lifetime. Only an estimated 46% will ever report the crime.</p>
                    <div class="fact">
                        <p>In the United States, on average, every two minutes, someone has been sexually assaulted. This leads to about 213,000 victims of sexual assault.</p>

                    <div class="myth">
                        <p class="question">Rape is a crime about sex.</p>
                        <p class="answer">Rape is a violent crime aimed at the control, manipulation, and humiliation of the victim. Rape is experienced by the victims as an act of violence, and they feel that it is a life- threatening experience.</p>

                    <h1>Self Defense</h1>
                    <p><strong>Think:</strong> As your daughter walks alone across a mall parking lot, she has the uneasy feeling she is being followed. She glances behind only to see an unassuming middle-aged man walking toward her. She walks faster, but within seconds he grabs her from behind and pushes her between two cars. Does she know what to do? The key to surviving a threatening situation is to have a plan and to act upon it quickly.</p>
                    <p>There are three types of defense that you need to be prepared for. Mental defense, verbal defense, and physical defense.</p>
                    <h2>Mental Defense</h2>
                    <p>Being mentally prepared is your first defense. The first thing to remember is to keep your eyes open. It is good to be aware of your surroundings, and watchful of those who are present with you. Always be looking for possible ways to escape should something occur. Evaluate the situation and decide. Think, “If this happens, I’ll do that.”</p>
                    <p>Keep mental notes of everything around you. This works to keep your mind flowing and helps to keep you calm. It also makes you more prepared, as you’ve already made your decisions.</p>
                    <div class="tip">
                        <p>Law enforcement and emergency medical services use mock scenarios in order to practice for if an event ever occurred. Crisis rehearsal is the best way to prepare. It will help train your mind and body to react quickly.</p>
